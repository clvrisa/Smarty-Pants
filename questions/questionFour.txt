Advantages of TDD include: Less Code- The code you write is the simplest code possible, the code becomes easier 
to check features and easier to maintain. Less debugging.

Disadvantages of TDD are that tests help to seek out bugs, but they can not find bugs that you simply introduce within 
the test code and in implementation code. Also tests need to be maintained because the code has got to. Whenever 
requirements change, you would like to vary the code and tests.
